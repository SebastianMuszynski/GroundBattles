_Designed and created during 24 hours at 2nd Galileo Hackathon in Gdynia, Poland._

## Idea

Our idea was to create a social game inspired by a real – often cruel – world, where we could use the most recent location-tracking possibilities in order to connect the entire world by creating a fun and healthy challenge. Imagine you enter a new land and nobody has discovered it yet. JUST-TAKE-IT-OVER and do not let other users to take it back from you. The more land you have, the more powerful person you become.

## How-To

Walk around the city (or any other area) and look for a new, not taken yet land. Try to grab as much as possible in one go. We are tracking your steps and your path will be your area’s border. Be careful, though! If you become too greedy, other users may take over your ground much faster than you!
